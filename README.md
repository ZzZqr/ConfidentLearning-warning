Please make sure that you have installed the required python libraries, e.g., cleanlab, sklearn, numpy, etc. Currently, our tool uses version 2.3.1 of the cleanlab package, version 1.25.2 of the numpy package, version 1.4.2 of the cleanlab package.

The only thing you have to do is running the main function in "main.py".

```
python3 main.py

You can view input datasets in folder "input_data", and view all these outnput datasets in folder "output_data", including output from cleanlab and performance of the ensemble model.
